# Minecraft-Inspired Game in Godot (C#)

This project is an adaptation of the **Learn Godot by Making Minecraft - Complete Crash Course** created by [LegionGames](https://www.youtube.com/@legiongames2400). The original tutorial was developed using GDScript, but the code in this project has been translated to C# for those who prefer to work with C# in Godot.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a learning resource for those interested in creating a Minecraft-like game using the Godot Engine. It covers key concepts such as:

- 3D game development in Godot
- Block-based world generation
- Handling player inputs and interactions
- Working with physics and collisions
- Optimizing game performance

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Godot Engine.
3. Review the C# scripts and scene structure to understand the implementation.
4. Play the game and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
